And while people are less informed about the news when they are away from Facebook, it also cooled partisan thinking. Facebook and other social media companies have gotten a bad rap for allegedly making us more polarized, making us depressed, making us addicted, and we wanted to rigorously test whether or not this is actually true, Hunt Allcott, an economics professor at New York University, and one of the co-authors of the study, told The Washington Post in an interview Thursday. The most remarkable thing is that our results do not support a strong anti-Facebook narrative, nor do they support a strong pro-Facebook narrative. In a statement to The Washington Post Thursday, Facebook said its teams are focused on fostering meaningful connections on the platform and have provided tools for users to better control their experience. This is one study of many on this topic and it should be considered that way, the company said, repeating the studys own findings that users find clear benefits from the platform and that Facebook helps people stay informed. The New York Times earlier reported on the study, which was posted on the open access research portal SSRN, and will be released as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper on Monday. The researchers did urge caution in interpreting their results, noting that people could have reacted differently if their break from Facebook was longer. That might have altered how users learned about the news and could have changed how they perceived their well-being. The types of people in the experiment also may have influenced the results, the researchers said. One question the researchers hope to pursue in the future is whether following news on social media is any more or less polarizing than consuming news through mainstream media, said Sarah Eichmeyer, a graduate student in economics at Stanford, and another co-author of the study. The 2,844 Facebook users involved in the study, which took place in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, was not a fully representative sample, the study said. Participants were relatively young, well-educated, and left-leaning compared to the average Facebook user, and the study only included people who said they were on Facebook for more than 15 minutes every day.
